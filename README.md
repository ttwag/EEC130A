# EEC130AB - Electromagnetics

This repository contains lecture notes of the EEC130 series from the University of California, Davis. The series covers the theoretical foundations behind Electromagnetism. It is important for Electrical Engineering students who want to go into the Radio Frequency sub-field.

## Course Content

### EEC130A

* [Transmission Line Basics](./lecture/Transmission_Line.md)
* [Electrostatics](./lecture/Electrostatics.md)
* [Magnetostatics](./lecture/Magnetostatics.md)
* [Electrodynamics and Maxwell's Equations](./lecture/Electrodynamics.md)

### EEC130B

* [Electromagnetic Plane Wave Propagation](./lecture/Electromagnetic_Wave_Propagation.md)
* [Reflection and Transmission](./lecture/Reflection_and_transmission.md)
* [Waveguides](./lecture/Waveguides.md)


## Why Study Electromagnetics?

* With knowledge of electric and magnetic fields, we can store and process information and energy.
* With knowledge of electromagnetic waves, we can transmit information and energy.
